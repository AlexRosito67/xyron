# Hasaki 刃先

> **Neural networks for microcontrollers that were never meant to run them.**

Hasaki is a command-line tool that trains a neural network on your desktop and exports a single, self-contained C header file — ready to drop into any embedded project. 

**No runtime. No framework. No TensorFlow Lite. Just pure C and a microcontroller.**

### ⚡ The Proof
> *"I ran MNIST on an ESP32-C3 — no TensorFlow, no TFLite, no ML runtime of any kind."*
> → [Read the full writeup on dev.to](https://dev.to/alexrosito67/i-ran-mnist-on-an-esp32-c3-without-tensorflow-tflite-or-any-ml-runtime-1cjk)

## How it works

1. Train your model on your desktop using Hasaki
2. Hasaki exports a `.h` file containing the trained weights and a ready-to-call `predict()` function
3. Drop the header into your embedded project and call it from your main loop

```c
#include "model.h"

float input[2] = { 1.0f, 0.0f };
float output[1];

predict(input, output);
// output[0] → 0.987
```

No heap allocation. No dependencies. No runtime overhead. If it compiles for your target, it runs.

---

## Who is this for

- Embedded developers who need inference on MCUs with no room for TensorFlow Lite
- Engineers prototyping edge AI on cheap, widely available hardware
- Anyone who needs a trained model deployed as a single C header

## Quick start

Download the binary for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/AlexRosito67/hasaki/releases/latest):

| Platform | Binary |
|---|---|
| Linux | `hasaki_free_linux` |
| Windows | `hasaki_free_windows.exe` |
| macOS | `hasaki_free_macos` |

Make the binary executable and add it to your `PATH`.

> 💡 **Note on Binary Names:** The examples below use the generic `hasaki` command. If you are using the Free version, your local binary will be named `hasaki_free_xxxx` (or `.exe` on Windows). If you have purchased a [Hasaki Pro license](https://hasaki.lemonsqueezy.com/checkout/buy/dd9388d0-83ee-4005-b30d-1437045215a1), your binary will be named `hasaki_pro_linux` or `hasaki_pro_windows.exe` and will unlock all advanced CLI flags (like Adam optimizer, batch processing, and INT8 quantization).

### Train an XOR classifier

```bash
hasaki -d 2,4,1 \
    -act sigmoid,sigmoid \
    -e 500 \
    -l 0.1 \
    -f examples/xor.csv \
    -o xor_model.txt

Model saved to: xor_model.txt
```

### Run inference

```bash
hasaki -d 2,4,1 -act sigmoid,sigmoid -a predict -m xor_model.txt -v "1.0,0.0"
```

---


### Export to C header

```bash
hasaki -d 2,4,1 -act sigmoid,sigmoid -a export -m xor_model.txt -o model.h -q float
```
---



## Recovering the best model after a manual stop

If you stop training manually before it finishes, the best model is preserved in a temporary file named `<output>.best_tmp`. To recover it:

**Linux / macOS:**
```bash
cp model.txt.best_tmp model.txt
```

**Windows:**
```powershell
Copy-Item model.txt.best_tmp model.txt
```

After recovering, you can validate, export, or resume training normally.

---

## Examples included

- `examples/xor.csv` — binary classification, the classic smoke test
- `examples/regression_1d.csv` — simple 1D regression
- `examples/softmax_toy.csv` — multiclass classification

---

## Real-world deployment

Hasaki was used to train and deploy a neural network on an **ESP32-C3** — one of the smallest, cheapest MCUs available — running MNIST digit classification with no ML runtime whatsoever.

→ [Full project and source code](https://github.com/AlexRosito67/hasaki-mnist-esp32)  
→ [dev.to writeup](https://dev.to/alexrosito67/i-ran-mnist-on-an-esp32-c3-without-tensorflow-tflite-or-any-ml-runtime-1cjk)

Hasaki was also used to train a regression model on real-world medical data — the Framingham Heart Study dataset — predicting systolic blood pressure from 14 patient vitals. The model (`14,32,16,1`) achieved an RMSE of 10.4 mmHg and exported as an INT8-quantized **8.9 kB** C header, with negligible accuracy loss versus the float model.
